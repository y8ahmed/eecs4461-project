### Section 1: Phenomena of Interest

Our project will explore the phenomenon of Echo Chambers driven by social bots within modern media ecosystems. In this scenario, AI-driven bots, configured to promote particular narratives, interact not only with human users but also with other bots. Over time, these automated agents reinforce and magnify each other’s messages, creating self-sustaining information bubbles. This intensification leads to more polarized viewpoints, as users (human or bot) primarily encounter content that confirms their existing beliefs. By modeling such bot-to-bot interactions, we aim to illustrate how echo chambers can form and persist, even with minimal human oversight.

The echo chamber dynamic may be observed across social media platforms showing that automated echo chambers pose considerable challenges to information diversity and public discourse. For instance, Twitter (now known as X) bots have the potential to distort discourse formation through misrepresentation of data and this could be weaponized by malicious actors (Hartt et al., 2024).

### Justification of Topic Choice

By analyzing how AI-driven bots maintain ideological divides and magnify narratives, our topic on social bot-driven echo chambers ties in with course themes such as Media Ecosystems, Affordance Theory, and Human and Social Bot Roles. As observed on sites like Twitter, this phenomena raises questions of media manipulation, disinformation, and algorithmic influence (Hartt et al., 2024). Addressing information bias and the difficulties of digital media governance in the automated media environment of today need an understanding of these dynamics.
