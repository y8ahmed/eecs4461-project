# Ground Rules 

| Area | Principles & Norms *All members of the group agree to:*  |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Communication** | \- Use Discord as the primary means of contacting each other   \- Mel is sometimes overwhelmed by Discord so other team mates should text her when there is an update \- Respond to messages within 48 hours \- Speak one at a time and refrain from interrupting others Communication \- Take turns listening as well as talking  |
| **Meetings** | \- Use Google Drive as the primary means of organizing and sharing documents \- Be punctual and communicate absence/lateness ahead of time \- Use Zoom as preferred platform for real-time conversations  |
| **Deadlines** | \- Complete tasks assigned in time for key project deadlines \- Give at least 1 hour of buffer before submitting work \- Finish the task a day earlier than the deadline so we have time to review \- Ask for help if facing a hindrance to completing work on time |

| Care Statement Outline here how the team will strive to care for the health of each other and the team as a whole during the project duration: |
| :---- |
| \- We will start each meeting with a 5-10min check in session \- If a member is struggling with a specific task, they can ask for clarification and help, but that does not mean someone else will do their task they can just help them.  |

| Performance Agreement Considers how the group will address non-performance of what is agreed to. Whatever the group agrees upon should correspond to the impact or gravity of the issues at hand. |
| :---- |
| Non-performance may include consistently not completing assigned tasks or not responding to messages in a timely manner, and other acts that hinder the team from completing its goals. We agree that if we cannot meet an obligation we will notify the group in advance.  We agree that if majority of the team feels that a member is non-performing, they may petition with the professor for the member’s grade to be reduced proportionally  |
