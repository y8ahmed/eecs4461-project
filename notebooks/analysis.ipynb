    "# TikTok Echo Chamber Model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The TikTok Echo Chamber model seeks to simulate the creation and sustenance of echo chambers on TikTok via bot to bot interactions. It utilizes agent-based modelling to demonstrate how agents - human or bot - of varying political leanings - conservative, progressive or neutral - interact with one another and take-on/lose each other's political leanings, eventually finding themselves surrounded by agents with similar leanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model categorizes interactions like following, sharing, commenting and liking as positive interactions since they promote connection and increase the likelihood of political leanings being adopted. Conversely, interactions like unfollowing and disliking are thus categorized as negative interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents are randomly placed on a graph. Human agents start off neutral to reflect a non-tailored For You Page (FYP) when a new user joins TikTok. There is at least one bot agent in the network and bot agents, as in real life, start off with a non-neutral political leaning with the goal of spreading that leaning. Human agents are able to have positive or negative interactions with other agents, while bot agents can only have positive interactions since they aim to spread their leanings. Upon a positive interaction, an agent tries to pass on its leaning to another. Upon a negative interaction, the receiving agent will try to change its political leaning to something other than the initiating agent's.\n",
    "\n",
    "While individual human agents may interact with others of dissimilar leanings, the amplification of some leaning by bots near the human agent nonetheless leads to clusters of similar leanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a demonstration of running the TikTok Echo Chamber model in an IPython Notebook. The actual model and agent code are implemented in the src directory of this Github repo. Below, we will import the model class, instantiate it, run it, and plot the time series of the number of happy agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that you may have to edit the source code since imports may not be identified in different settings. If the below import fails, make the following changes\n",
    "\n",
    "In src/app.py change:\n",
    "<code>from agents import</code> to <code>from src.agents import</code>\n",
    "<code>from model import</code> to <code>from src.model import</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "In src/model.py change:\n",
    "<code>from agents import</code> to <code>from src.agents import</code>"
